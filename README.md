### Where to Buy

These links are for the OrangeCrab 85F, which uses the 85F variant of the
[Lattice ECP5 fpga](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5).
There is also an OrangeCrab 25F. If you want to reproduce experiments in
this repo, keep in mind that I'm using an OrangeCrab r0.2.1 85F.
