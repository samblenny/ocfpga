# 10 Try VexRiscv


## Goals:

1. Compile a [VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) CPU from
   SpinalHDL to Verilog using scala.

2. Translate a Verilog VexRiscv CPU into an ECP5 bitstream with YosysHQ tools.

3. Write Verilog to wire the CPU up to an observable output: blink the LED,
   flip a GPIO pin, export a register to JTAG, or anything I can get working.

4. Write a C program, compile it, and run it on the CPU. Anything I can get
   working to produce observable output would be fine.


## Questions

Can I use Debian's [scala](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/scala) package?
The [Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Scala) describes Debian's Scala as
"fairly outdated version". When I read about what's involved in installing an
up to date Scala, it sounds like something I'd rather not have to deal with.
